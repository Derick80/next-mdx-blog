## Fly Setup

1. [Install `flyctl`](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

2. Sign up and log in to Fly

```sh
flyctl auth signup
```

                <Button

      >

click mode

</Button>
3. Setup Fly. It might ask if you want to deploy, say no since you haven't built the app yet.

```sh
flyctl launch
```

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

If you've followed the setup instructions already, all you need to do is run this:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

## Custom Domain

Initially my domain was on Google Domains, but I moved it to SquareSpace. After migration I had to remove the default SquareSpace DNS records and add the Fly.io DNS records.

I created certificates for VariantAlleles.com and [www.VariantAlleles.com](https://www.variantalleles.com) using the fly CLI.

```sh
flyctl certs create [VariantAlleles.com](https://variantalleles.com)

flyctl certs create [www.VariantAlleles.com](https://www.variantalleles.com)
```

For [www.VariantAlleles.com](https://www.variantalleles.com)I added the following DNS records:

```sh
A @ public-ip-address
A @ IPV6-address
```

For [www.VariantAlleles.com](https://www.variantalleles.com) I added the following DNS records:

```sh
CNAME www FLYDEV-APP-NAME.fly.dev
```

## Consequences

```
function getImageBuilder (
    id: string,
    alt: string = '',
    { className, style }: { className?: string; style?: CSSProperties } = {},
): ImageBuilder {
    function imageBuilder (transformations?: TransformerOption) {
        return buildImageUrl(id, { transformations })
    }
    imageBuilder.alt = alt
    imageBuilder.id = id
    imageBuilder.className = className
    imageBuilder.style = style
    return imageBuilder
}
```
